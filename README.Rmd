# Roel's Personal Templates package
This is a nice and opinionated package with templates, primarily for personal
use. I use these templates 
to make sure I keep to best practices, and frankly to just help remind me of 
stuff I tend to forget.


# Current status of project
Some of the templates are for other projects, mostly online, and 
some are more specific for R-packages.


#### Non-packages
- [] rscripts (using date, names and stuff)
- [] rmarkdown for blogdown post 
- [] travis file for non-package 

#### Specifically for packages
- [] rmarkdown readme for packages
- [] markdown readme for packages (if there is no need for rmd file)
- [] standard .gitignore file
- [] travis file that also lints and codecov
- [] standard vignette
- [] changelog

## Example usage

`template::rscript()`

## Installation instructions
*Really, you should probably not install this on your computer if you are not me. But you could fork and modify it as [![fork this repo](http://githubbadges.com/fork.svg?user=RMHogervorst&repo=templates&style=flat&color=lightgrey&background=4c1)](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/templates/fork) have done.* 
Install the package using devtools. `devtools::install_github("rmhogervorst/template")` templates is already a seperate repo... Confusing right?


*Yes I realise I am not using the best practices here*
